# Plant Identifier Project ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒºðŸŒ»ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ»

## Introduction

Welcome to the Plant Identifier project! This project is designed to help users identify various plant species by uploading or taking pictures of plants. It uses Flask, OpenCV, Python, and Jinja to create a website that offers features such as user registration, login, logout, image recognition, and detailed plant information display.

## Features

### User Authentication

1. **User Registration**: Users can create an account by providing their username and password.

2. **User Login**: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials.

3. **User Logout**: Logged-in users can log out to end their session.

### Image Recognition

4. **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of plants directly to the website.

5. **Image Capture**: Users can capture pictures of plants using their device's camera.

6. **Plant Identification**: After uploading or capturing an image, the system uses OpenCV for image processing and plant recognition to identify the plant species.

### Plant Information

7. **Plant Information Page**: Once the plant is identified, users can view detailed information about the plant, including its common name, scientific name, habitat, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shashwatshikharsingh/plant-identifier.git
   cd plant-identifier
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
